Notes
-----
- Allot of stuff not found in the gui can be enabled via the ini file. I wanted to keep it as simple as possible so only important stuff are kept in the gui. If you need information on how to use something just ask.
- Press [Insert] to bring up the in-game settings menu and use the arrow keys to navigate. Be warned it is poorly implemented. When this project has matured a bit more, it can be used to change gpu clocks and fan speeds while in-game :)
